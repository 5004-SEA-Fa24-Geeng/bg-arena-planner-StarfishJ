 * Students, you will need to implement the methods in this interface in a class called
 * Planner.java. You can assume the constructor of Planner.java takes in a Set<BoardGame> as a
 * parameter. This represents the total board game collection.
 * An important note, while most of methods return streams, each method builds on each other / is
 * progressive. As such if filter by minPlayers, then filter by maxPlayers, the maxPlayers filter
 * should be applied to the results of the minPlayers filter unless reset is called between.

     * Filters the board games by the passed in text filter.
     * A text filter can contain the following options:
     * > : greater than
     * < : less than
     * >= : greater than or equal to
     * <= : less than or equal to
     * == : equal to
     * != : not equal to
     * ~= : contains the text
     * The left side of the filter describes the column to filter on. The right side of the filter
     * describes the value to filter on.
     * Fo example:
     * minPlayers>4
     * would filter the board games to only those with a minimum number of players greater than 4.
     * Commas between filters are treated as ANDs. For example:
     * minPlayers>4,maxPlayers<6
     * It is possible to filter on the same column multiple times. For example:
     * minPlayers>4,minPlayers<6
     * This would filter the board games to only those with a minimum number of players greater than
     * 4 and less than 6.
     * Spaces should be ignored, but can be included for readability. For example:
     * minPlayers > 4
     * is the same as
     * minPlayers>4
     * If filtering on a string column, the filter should be case insensitive. For example:
     * name~=pandemic
     * would filter the board games to only those with the word "pandemic" in the name, but could
     * also have Pandemic or PANDEMIC.
     * Column names will match the values in GameData. As such is it possible to use
     * GameData.MIN_PLAYERS.getColumnName() or GameData.fromString("minplayers") to get the column
     * name for the minPlayers column.
     * Note: id is a special column that is not used for filtering or sorting.
     * if the filter is empty (""), then the results should return the current filter sorted based
     * on the sortOn column and in the defined direction.
     * @param filter The filter to apply to the board games.
     * @param sortOn The column to sort the results on.
     * @param ascending Whether to sort the results in ascending order or descending order.
     * @return A stream of board games that match the filter.
